Offset printer colors packer

This script reads *pdf* files and generates *ry4* files for use in offset printers.
It uses CAM::PDF module to be able to read the PDFs. This module can be installed by issuing the next command:

    cpan -i CAM::PDF

In fact this (besides perl) is the only requirement to run the script. It starts a web server and works trought HTML5 captable browser.
